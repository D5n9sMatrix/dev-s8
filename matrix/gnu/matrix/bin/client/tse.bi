An important property of a direct sum decomposition is that it allows
a unique representation of a vector in the decomposed space in terms of a
sum of vectors from the individual essentially disjoint spaces; that is, if V =
V1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Vn is a direct sum decomposition of V and v ∈ V, then there exist
unique vectors vi ∈ Vi such that
